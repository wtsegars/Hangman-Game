# Hangman-Game
This is a baics hangman-style game that is centered around the theme of memes of the internet. The object of the game is to guess what the name of one of several memes by typing it in on the keyboard one letter at a time. For each one that is right, it will appear on the screen where the letter(s) as supposed to appear in the name of the meme until the meme's name is fully guessed. If the letter does not appear in the name of the meme, then the player will lose a life. If the player runs out of lives, then a picture will appear on the screen prompting the player to refresh the page to try again. If the player completes the name of the meme, then a picture of the specific meme will appear on the screen and an alert will appear to tell the player that they won the game and to refresh the page to play again. Outside of HTML and CSS, this game functions on plain, vanilla JavaScript.
